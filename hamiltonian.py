    Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph with n vertices.
    If for all pairwise nonadjacent vertex-triples u, v, and w it holds that 
    d(u) + d(v) + d(w) >= 1/2(3n-5)        | d(x) denotes the degree of a node x
    then G has a Hamiltonian path.

    If G is a simple graph (no repeated edges or self-edges) on n vertices and d(u)+d(v)â‰¥n-1 
    whenever u and v are not adjacent, then G has a Hamilton path. 
Pseudocode:

numpoints = n
curPoints = 0
blocks = [] \make the blocks a class
G = [] --> Graph with n vertices \make the graphs a class
block class:
    possess x and y coords
    know block it was derived from
    know the theta and mag of the transformation

    Brute force and dfs from every node to see if its hamiltonian O(N*(M+N))
