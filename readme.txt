Project Description:
    A fun puzzle game designed using graph theory and computational geometry 
    to challenege the user to find a path in a complex system.  
Structural Plan:
    The game will have a title screen stage, a loading bar potentially to generate a valid game board, the game screen, 
    and if the user beats the level there will be a section asking if they want to increase the difficulty.
Algorithmic Plan:
    Utilize Dynamic Programming to find a hamiltonian path in the game board. Generate a game board by using Voronoi Diagrams and Bowyer Watson Algorithms
Timeline Plan:
    Finish geometry by end of week and spend 1-2 days doing the graph theory part of the problem
Version Control Plan:
    I'm using GitHub to host and keep track of any changes of my project.
